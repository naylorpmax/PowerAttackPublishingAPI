Accumulated Knowledge,2,Divination,1 bonus action,Touch,"V, S",Instantaneous,Wizard,Nemesis,"When you cast this spell, you immediately learn one factual piece of information about the creature or object you touched which you did not know before. The depth of the knowledge gained in this way varies depending upon how many times you've cast this spell since the end of your last long rest.
 1st casting: You learn one simple fact about the target which is public or widely held knowledge. This could include when the target was created or its date of birth, the name it most frequently goes by, what materials it is made of, who created the object, or the last creature to interact with it in some way.
 2nd casting: You learn one fact about the target which is not well-known, or might be considered a minor secret. This could include the target's alignment, the birth name of a humanoid, any spells affecting the target, or any resistances or vulnerabilities the target has, or a secret that the target keeps from others.
 3rd casting or more: You learn one fact about the target which is almost entirely unknown, or is considered to be a major secret. This could be the true name of a powerful being such as a devil or dragon, a list of abilities which the target has or spells that it knows, a magical ritual necessary to destroy the target, or secrets unknown even to the target itself.
 When you cast the spell, you can attempt to learn specific information by asking a question as you do so, such as ""What is this object made of?"" or ""Who was the last one person this creature spoke to?"" However, if the DM decides this question falls outside of the scope of what could be learned using this casting of the spell, they can choose to provide different information instead.If there is no information to be learned about the target that you do not already know, the spell fails; however, it still counts towards the number of times you have cast the spell since the end of your last long rest.

The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or immediately be teleported to your location, appearing in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet. After it appears, chains of magical energy wrap themselves around the creature and sink into its skin, becoming magical tattoos which cause the creature to be charmed by you and place it under your control.

The target can repeat the saving throw if given a command that is harmful to itself, or if you or your allies harm or threaten it, ending the spell on itself on a success. When the spell ends, the target can choose to either remain in its current location, or be teleported back to its previous location before the spell was cast.

Choose up to four beasts which you have seen before, and which can not be more than one size larger or smaller than the target.

A creature restrained by the webs automatically takes 2d6 acid and 2d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns as it is attacked by the spiders. Any nonmagical armor the restrained creature is wearing and any nonmagical weapon it is carrying suffers a permanent, cumulative -1 penalty at the start of each turn that it remains restrained. If this penalty reaches -5, the armor or weapon is destroyed. A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained, and the spell ends. The webs are flammable, and when exposed to fire burn away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to the restrained creature.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the acid and piercing damage each increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

On its turn, a creature may use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw for each chain attached to it. For every success, one of the chains attached to the creature is broken or slips loose, and the creature is no longer restrained by it.

If you move beyond this range, the knowbot disappears in 2d4 rounds, as if the duration of the spell had expired. Moving within this range again immediately reestablishes the bond. The knowbot is bound to the system in which it was created, and it stays there until it is dismissed or the spell’s duration expires.

Synchronicity grants advantage to Dexterity (Stealth) checks, since the target always finds a handy piece of cover available.

If a target collides with a solid surface during this movement, they take an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage. On a success, a target takes only half damage, and no other effects.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 3rd."

Weight,1,Transmutation,1 action (ritual),Touch,"V, S, M (a small ball of lead)",8 hrs,"Cleric, Paladin, Sorcerer",Other Homebrew Spells,"This spell is used to guard against theft by increasing the weight of a container when anyone other than the caster attempts to pick it up. This spell affects a single touched container, such as a chest or pouch, which takes up no more space than a 5 ft. cube. When any creature besides the caster attempts to pick up the container, the weight of the container increases to 1d4+1 times the weight of the creature. When casting the spell, the caster may also specify a number of creatures equal to their spellcasting modifier who may also freely pick up the container. Picking up a creature who has picked up the container does not cause the container’s weight to increase."
Wild Guess,1,Divination,1 action (ritual),300 ft,"S, M (a flower with all of its petals intact)",Instantaneous,"Bard, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard",Other Homebrew Spells,"When this spell is cast, the caster immediately knows an approximate guess at the number of individuals in a certain group. This may be a group of creatures or a pile of items, but all individuals in the group must be within range of the spell, and the caster must be able to discern individual members of the group. This spell automatically rounds to the largest factor of ten within the counted group when estimating; so a pile of 1,780 gold coins will give a result of 2,000, while a group of 68 swordsmen will give a result of 70.
 At Higher Levels. When casting this spell at higher levels, it allows you to count with greater accuracy. Casting this spell with a 3rd level spell slot estimates to the second highest factor of ten instead. Casting this spell with a 5th level spell slot estimates to the third highest factor of ten. Casting this spell with a 7th level spell slot estimates to the fourth highest factor of ten, and casting it with a 9th level spell slot estimates to the fifth highest factor of ten."
Wind Whispers,4,Enchantment,1 action,120 ft,V,Instantaneous,"Bard, Ranger, Warlock",Other Homebrew Spells,"Your whispers are laced with terrible secrets of pain and sadness. Choose a target within range. Your whispered phrases penetrate the deepest layers of its mind. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d12 psychic damage and become stunned until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and is not stunned.

In your free hand, you conjure a dagger of black glass from the tear, which lasts for the duration of the spell. You are proficient with the woeful dagger and you may use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage roll. The woeful dagger is a magic weapon and deals 2d4 piercing damage on a hit. Once during the spell’s duration, when you hit a creature with the woeful dagger, you may choose to make a woeful strike, planting the dagger into the creature and releasing it. If you do so, the creature you hit must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 12d10 psychic damage and suffers disadvantage on all saves for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and no disadvantage on saves. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. Regardless of whether the creature succeeds or fails, the spell ends and the woeful dagger disappears after the attack, fading into black smoke."

A corpse can be used for this spell only once; after it has been marked by the spell it can not be used in the same way again."

The air in a 30-foot radius around the chosen point becomes heavy with foul magic, animating any corpses in the area. Any pile of bones or corpse of a humanoid of Medium or Small size in the radius that you choose animates as a skeleton if it was bones, or a zombie if it was a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics.) On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any number of creatures you made with this spell, so long as the creature is on the same plane of existence. You decide what action the creatures will take and where they will move during their next turns, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creatures defend themselves and you against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. After 24 hours the spell ends, and any creature animated by the spell becomes a mundane corpse.
 Flashback. If you've already cast this spell since the end of your last long rest, you can instead choose to cast it as a Flashback spell. If you do so, the range of the spell and the radius of the area affected by the spell both double. After doing so, you can't cast this spell again until the end of your next long rest."

If the creature's soul is free, the creature is turned into a ghost with all of its hit points, ability scores, and saving throw and skill proficiencies. An unwilling creature can make a Charisma saving throw, resisting the effects of the spell on a success. On a failed save or if the target is willing, the ghost appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you. The ghost retains all of the memories of its life. The ghost is charmed by you, and must follow any commands that you give to it. If you command the ghost to do something it doesn't want to do, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the ghost is not forced to follow any commands you give to it for the next hour. The ghost remains for one week, at which point it disappears unless you spend 10 minutes to cast this spell again, targeting the ghost. If the ghost does not want to remain, it can attempt another Charisma saving throw to resist the effects of the spell."

The next time before the end of the spell's duration that a target would take a long rest, they instead need half as much time to gain the benefits of a long rest, and if they would sleep during this time, they instead meditate, remaining semiconscious.
 Morbid. If the target of the spell takes damage or is killed during the spell's duration, you receive a mental alarm alerting you of the fact, which automatically awakens you if you are sleeping."

For some this is a boon; for others, a punishment. When you cast this spell, if the target is a willing creature, for the duration they gain resistance to radiant damage, and their weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 radiant damage. If the target is not willing, they must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target gains the benefits of the spell, and can not willingly attack you or your allies for the spell's duration. The spell ends if you or your allies injure the target. The spell automatically fails if the target's Intelligence is 3 or lower."
Bramblecrush,6,Conjuration,1 action,60 ft,"V, S, M (a thorny stem)","Concentration, up to 10 min.",Druid,Innistrad,"As you cast this spell, a tangle of thorny brambles grows from a spot of your choice in range that you can see, quickly spreading to fill a 20-foot radius. Each creature in the radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, creatures are caught in the brambles, which begin to clamp down and squeeze, causing them to begin suffocating. A creature caught in the brambles has its speed reduced to 0, and can't benefit from any increase to its speed. Creatures caught in the brambles automatically take 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of their turns, and can use an action on their turn to make another Dexterity saving throw, freeing themselves on a success. On a failed save, a creature takes an additional 1d6 piercing damage. The radius of the brambles count as difficult terrain. Creatures that enter the brambles for the first time on their turn or which begin their turn in the brambles but aren't trapped there must make a Dexterity saving throw or become caught in the brambles. Each 5-foot section of the brambles can be destroyed, and has AC 10, 20 hit points, vulnerability to fire and slashing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. When a creature hits a section of the brambles with a melee attack, they must make a Strength saving throw or be pulled into the tangling brambles. When the spell ends, the brambles immediately wither and crumble away.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the radius of the brambles increases by 5 ft. for each slot level above 6th."

Each creature in a 30-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 bludgeoning and 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Flammable objects in the radius not being worn or carried ignite.
 Morbid. You can use your reaction to cast this spell when a creature that you can see in range is reduced to 0 hit points. If you do, the spell is automatically centered on the fallen creature, and the damage for the spell is increased to 4d8 bludgeoning and 4d8 fire damage."

A frightened creature takes an additional 1d6 psychic damage and can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect if it is successful. If you are in dim light or darkness when you cast this spell, the target has disadvantage on the original saving throw.
 Flashback. If you've already cast this spell since the end of your last long rest, you can instead choose to cast it as a Flashback spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher. If you do so, each creature of your choice within 30 ft. that can hear you must make an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effects of the spell.

For the duration of the spell, whenever a creature within range that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to make a ranged attack against the creature, dealing 4d4 fire damage on a hit. You can also use your reaction to make the same ranged attack against a creature whenever you cast a Necromancy spell.

If the target is unwilling, they must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell components grow and twist to become a copy of the target, an almost perfect replica. The copy has the same statistics and personality as the target, except that its hit points and alignment are the same as yours, and it does not share the target's memories. The copy acts on its own initiative and willingly obeys your commands. The copy is is actively hostile towards the original target, and will actively attack the target unless commanded otherwise. If the copy is reduced to 0 hit points, it transforms back into the spell components if a silver hammer was used, otherwise the spell components are destroyed. A creature observing the copy must make a Wisdom (Investigation) check against your spell save DC in order to determine it is not the original; a creature familiar with the target has advantage on this saving throw. The creature might also automatically determine the nature of the copy, or at least become suspicious of it, through other means, such as asking the copy questions it doesn't have the answer to but should if it were the original.
 Flashback. If you've already cast this spell since the end of your last long rest, you can instead choose to cast it as a Flashback spell using a spell slot of 9th level.

If the target begins its turns in such an area, they must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes frightened, and can take no actions beyond attempting to leave the enclosed space. On a success, the spell ends for the target. The target must also repeat the saving throw if they begin their turn in combat surrounded by two or fewer unoccupied spaces, with the same results on a failed or successful saving throw.

The creature's Challenge Rating must be equal to or lower than (1/2) your level. If the creature doesn't have a CR, treat its level as its CR instead. Your necromantic magic quickly traps and binds the spirit of the dead creature to yourself, storing its energy for later use. If the target is a construct, the spell has no effect. Any time before the spell ends, you can use an action on your turn to transform the creature's soul into pure magical energy, launching it at a target you can see within 60 ft. of yourself. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, on a failed save taking an amount of necrotic damage equal to 1d6 x the CR of the original creature, or half as much on a success. After doing so, the captured soul is destroyed entirely, and the creature can't be resurrected except through use of the wish spell.

The corpses must be of a humanoid or Large or smaller beast, and rise as spore servants under your control in ascending order of CR (the DM has the template for the spore servant.)

Once per day, you can use a bonus action on your turn to command the assistant to use one of the abilities imprinted upon it, as if it were a magic item of that type.

Jaya's Immolating Inferno,9,Evocation,1 action,120 ft,"V, S",Instantaneous,"Sorcerer, Wizard",Dominaria,"When you cast this spell, you must expend an additional spell slot of 1st level or higher. You create several powerful blasts of fire, equal in number to the level of the expended spell slot, which seem to ignite the sky as they rip through the air. Choose a number of creatures up to the number of blasts created, and make a ranged spell attack against each target. The blasts all strike simultaneously and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. A target hit by a blast takes 10d6 fire damage, and a creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is automatically killed and turned to ash.

Kamahl's Druidic Vow,5,Transmutation,1 min (ritual),Self,"V, S, M (a slashing weapon, and a sapling less than a year old)",Instantaneous,"Bard, Paladin, Sorcerer",Dominaria,"You use the weapon to dig a hole in the ground, into which you plant the sapling, before driving the blade of your weapon into the ground behind the newly-planted tree, where it instantly rusts and tarnishes. You speak a small prayer over the plant, a promise of your new dedication to protecting nature's balance. When you finish casting this spell, choose a number of spells that you know or have prepared equal to the level of the spell slot used to cast this spell. You permanently lose the ability to cast those spells, and can not relearn them. You then choose an equal number of spells from the druid spell list, and gain the ability to cast those spells. The spells chosen must be of equivalent level to the spells lost. For example, if you choose to give up three 2nd level and two 3rd level spells that you know how to cast, you gain the ability to cast three 2nd level and two 3rd level spells from the druid spell list. Casting these spells requires preparing them and expending spell slots as normal.

Karn's Temporal Sundering,9,Conjuration,1 action (ritual),Touch,"V, S, M (a piece of silver worth at least 400 gp, consumed in the casting)",Instantaneous,"Sorcerer, Wizard",Dominaria,"As you cast this spell, the silver used as the material component melts and becomes liquid, then swallows a willing creature that you touch before vanishing entirely and reappearing in the same location at the end of your turn. The target is sent a short ways back in time, appearing in the same location or the nearest unoccupied space and allowing it to interact with the past without being interacted with. The target can take a number of actions up to or equal to your spellcasting modifier, whose effects are then retroactively applied, as determined by the DM. When the target reappears, it suffers one level of exhaustion for each action it chose to take. If you cast this spell as a ritual, you instead send the target back in time a number of hours of your choice, up to your spellcasting modifier, following the same rules as if the spell had been cast using a spell slot as normal. When the target reappears, it automatically suffers one level of exhaustion for each hour that it was sent back in time.

Lich's Mastery,9,Necromancy,8 hrs (ritual),Self,"V, S, M (the soul of a humanoid trapped using soul cage or some similar method and 5000 gp worth of magical black iron, both consumed in the casting)",Instantaneous,"Cleric, Warlock, Wizard",Dominaria,"As you cast this spell, you perform a ritual that slowly enmeshes your soul with the one that you've trapped, entwining them together into the iron, which shapes itself into a suit of armor made for you and bound forever to your skin. After casting this spell, you become an undead creature, and you no longer need to breathe, drink, eat, or sleep. You are immune to necrotic and poison damage, can not be diseased or poisoned, and can not suffer exhaustion except as a result of this spell. The magical iron binds itself to your skin in a highly painful process, becoming a suit of armor. You can not remove this armor, and while wearing it your AC is 17 and you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. The armor has a number of hit points equal to your maximum hit points at the time you cast the spell, and whenever you would take damage, the armor takes that damage instead. Damage to the armor manifests as pieces of the iron chipping off and falling to the ground, at which point they vanish into black dust. To repair the armor and restore its hit points, you must perform a magical ritual that takes 8 hours to complete, requires you to expend a 9th-level spell slot, and costs a number of gp equal to 10 x the number of hit points being restored to the armor. If the armor is reduced to 0 hit points it shatters, leaving behind only a few scraps attached to your body, and you must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you are reduced to 0 hit points and begin dying, and automatically fail any death saving throws. On a success, you instead take 4d10 necrotic damage and suffer one level of exhaustion, which can not be removed by taking a long rest. At the end of each long rest that the armor remains broken and unrepaired, you must make another Constitution saving throw, with the same results. In addition to the normal costs, repairing the armor once it has been reduced to 0 hit points also requires the soul of another humanoid trapped using soul cage or another method, which is expended in the process of repairing the armor.

If the target is an enemy, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or vanish without a sound. The target returns to the space it disappeared from at the end of its next turn.

Choose up to two creatures that you can see within range. The smoke moves and curls to wrap around those creatures, layering along their skin and transforming it into a shiny, black carapace. For 1 hour, each of those creatures is immune to necrotic damage and automatically succeeds on saving throws made to avoid becoming exhausted. Then at the start of your next turn, the cloud of smoke expands to fill a 60-foot radius around you where the smoke lingers until the spell ends. Each creature that begins its turn in the radius must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 14d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Then at the start of your third turn after casting this spell, each creature in the cloud of smoke must succeed on another Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

This gas remains for the duration of the spell, floating in the air between the two lenses without moving or dissipating, flashing with sparks of light and glimpses of movement. For every 10 minutes that you spend studying the gas and the movements within, you can ask the GM one question about the future and make a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, the GM answers the question to the best of their abilities with a short phrase, 25 words or less. The question must be related to events that will occur in the next 24 hours after the casting of this spell, and events which you will be present for. For instance, you may ask the chances of success for a particular course of action, whether or not a specific companion might betray the others, or whether a specific event will occur. You could not ask whether you will successfully arrive at a destination further than 24 hours away, or what might happen in a specific location that you could not reasonably get to in the allotted time. After receiving an answer to a question that you have asked, you can immediately expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to receive further information about the answer, another short phrase of 25 words or less.

After casting this spell, you must either move up to your speed or make a single weapon attack. This act is then added to the ACTION ORDER. At the start of each creature's turn in the initiative order, that creature must perform all acts currently in the ACTION ORDER, in the same order they were added. Movement made or actions taken to complete the ACTION ORDER do not count towards that creature's total movement speed or number of actions taken during the turn. If the creature succeeds in following the ACTION ORDER, the next act they take during their turn is then added to the ACTION ORDER. Adding a new act to the ACTION ORDER does require the use of the creature's normal movement speed and number of actions per turn. Only one act can be added to the ACTION ORDER each turn. If a creature fails to perform all acts in the ACTION ORDER in the correct sequence, or performs an act in the ACTION ORDER incorrectly, that creature is immediately reduced to 0 hit points and begins dying.Acts added to the ACTION ORDER only apply in the general sense. For example, if a creature adds a movement of 30 feet to the ACTION ORDER by flying 30 feet in any direction after performing the rest of the acts in the ACTION ORDER, any creature repeating that act must only move 30 feet in any direction by any means. Similarly, if a creature makes an attack, it doesn't matter what the attack was made with or who the attack was made against. Casting a spell can not be added as an act to the ACTION ORDER, and if a creature takes the Cast a Spell action as the first act on their turn, they do not add any acts to the ACTION ORDER.

During the spell's duration, if the target is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to transfer the effects of the spell to one charmed, restrained, or unconscious creature you can see within 10 feet.

Choose a number of corpses within range equal to the number of undead you are attempting to create. The corpses must be from Medium or Small humanoids. Each corpse becomes a zombie under your control (the GM has the creature's game statistics). If there is a large body of water within range, such as a large lake, a sea, or the ocean, at the GM's discretion the spell may instead animate a number of dead bodies from the body of water, without requiring the corpses to be in range.As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.

 Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, it produces additional effects on your turn. The radius of the spell moves with you, but while concentrating on the spell, you are unable to move more than 30 feet on your turn.
 Round 2. The gravity in the area of the spell is weakened, forcing each creature in the spell’s radius to succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted 30 feet into the air. Creatures with a flying speed automatically succeed on this saving throw. Creatures that fail the saving throw hover in the air, and their speed is reduced to 0. At the start of your next turn this effect ends, causing each creature that failed the save to fall to the ground, taking falling damage as normal.
 Round 3-4. Small meteorites begin to shoot through the air, forcing each creature other than yourself to make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid them. A creature that fails this saving throw takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.
 Round 5-6. Blinding cosmic light, unleashed by pulsars and supernovas, tears through the spell’s radius, causing each creature other than yourself to take 2d8 radiant damage. Each creature that suffers this damage must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of your next turn.
 Round 7. You summon three large meteoroids, which strike the ground at three spots of your choice you can see within the spell’s range, kicking up a large cloud of debris and exuding intense heat. Each creature within 30 feet of a chosen point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire and 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. A creature in the area of more than one impact is only affected once. Each meteor leaves a 15-foot wide radius of difficult terrain centered on its point of impact.
 Round 8. Dark shapes, the shadows of things left over from before the creation of light, shudder at the edges of the star-studded darkness, forcing each creature other than yourself in the spell’s radius that can see to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save an affected creature takes 4d6 psychic damage, immediately loses concentration, and is frightened until the spell ends.
 Round 9-10. The stars revealed by the spell fade away, plunging the spell’s area into total darkness. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it. If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell, the spell that created the light is dispelled.

This rift takes the form of a circular, 2-dimensional portal, oriented in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration.
 The front of the portal provides a view into the plane that it is connected to, while the back of the portal appears as an opaque, multicolored shape. Travel through the portal is impossible, and any creature that attempts to enter the portal from either side passes harmlessly through.
 When the portal is created, a number of random creatures or objects from elsewhere in the multiverse are forcibly drawn through it, appearing in the nearest unoccupied spaces on your side of the portal. You gain no special control over any creatures conjured this way, and they are free to act as the GM deems appropriate. They might flee, attack you, attack others, or even actively help you.
 Any creature summoned by the portal, as well as any equipment it is carrying or wearing, is returned to its previous location when the spell ends. Creatures summoned by the portal act at the end of each of your turns, including the turn in which it was summoned, unless noted otherwise.
 Roll a d20 on the table below to determine what appears from the portal.
 1: Ten random beasts of challenge rating ½ or below. The GM determines the type of beasts that appear, which might all be the same type of creature, or several different types.
 2: 1d6 bandits of various races, led by a two-headed bugbear.
 3: A gelatinous cube, whose appearance is not immediately obvious due to its transparency.
 4: A doppelganger that already has the same appearance as the nearest creature to it.
 5: An owlbear in the middle of hibernating. It wakes up if dealt damage, or whenever a creature enters a space within 5 feet of it and fails a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check.
 6: Two elephants, each ridden by a kobold.
 7: A weretiger mercenary, who offers their services to the highest bidder.
 8: 1d4 fiends of challenge rating 5 or below, all of the same type, with a 40% chance of being demons, a 40% chance of being devils, a 10% chance of being yugoloths, and a 10% chance of being none of the above. If devils, they will prioritize fighting any nearby demons above any other target and vice-versa.
 9: A single celestial of challenge rating 4 or below.
 10: A cloud of living fog that expands from the space it is summoned in at a rate of 5 feet in every direction at the start of each of your turns. Any creature that starts its turn in the fog must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d8 poison damage and become poisoned until the spell ends.
 11: A tamed giant boar, complete with saddle and reins, which allows itself to be ridden with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. A creature that attempts to ride the boar and fails the check is thrown from its back, landing prone in its previous space.
 12: A bard that comes equipped with a specialized instrument to act as a one-man band. The bard has a 50% chance of beginning a comedic song about nearby characters, and a 50% chance of telling a courageous epic poem. If performing the song, creatures within 60 feet of the bard that can see and hear it subtract 1d4 from all attack rolls and saving throws. If performing the poem, creatures within 60 feet of the bard that can see and hear it add 1d4 to all attack rolls and saving throws.
 13: Thirteen crawling claws appear, which all occupy the same space, act on the same turn, and move as one entity.
 14: A single, random card from the deck of many things, which appears face-down. The first creature to touch the card is immediately subject to its effects, which last only until the spell ends, at which point the effects of the card are reversed.
 15: Two gladiators, each with half of their normal hit points, caught in a life or death struggle. Each refuses to respond to outside intervention until the other is unconscious or killed.
 16: A flesh golem, which uses its first turn to take the Dash action and move in a random direction. The following round, 3d4 commoners appear, carrying torches and farming implements, attempting to chase and kill the flesh golem.
 17: A large, golden sarcophagus, inside of which is a mummy lord, currently in a state of suspended animation. On each of the mummy lord’s turns after it is summoned, including the first, there is an additional 10% chance that it wakes from its slumber and leaves the sarcophagus.
 18: Three werewolves– one in its human form, one in its hybrid form, and one in its wolf form, all of which are incapable of polymorphing into a different form for the duration.
 19: A shambling mound that begins at Medium size, and grows by an additional size category, up to a maximum of Huge, each time it takes lightning damage or reduces a creature it has engulfed to 0 hit points.
 20: A vampiric mist that does not take damage from sunlight, and spends each of its turns seeking an area of dim light or darkness. If it begins its turn in dim light or darkness, it transforms into a vampire. If the vampire begins its turns in sunlight, after taking radiant damage it transforms back into vampiric mist."
Cityscape,9,Transmutation,24 hrs,Self,"V, S, M (a scale-model replica of the area affected by the spell, of a value determined by the area’s size)",30 days,"Bard, Wizard",Spooktober 2021 Homebrew Spells,"You imprint the signature of your magic onto a large area within a village, town, or city, creating a deep and lasting bond between yourself and the chosen surroundings. The area affected by the spell must be no larger than 1500 square feet. This is usually equivalent to a medium farmstead, a town square, or a city block. You must remain within the area you are marking for the duration of the spell’s casting.
 The scale replica of the spell’s area of effect used in the spell’s casting must be an exact duplicate, replicating both buildings and other structures within the area as well as any other major geographical features. Your GM has the final say on what counts as a feature prominent enough to be included in the scale replica. Building interiors and underground structures do not need to be represented in the model, but the scale of the model must have a moderate degree of accuracy. Constructing such a model usually requires 1 day and 3 gp for every 5 square feet represented in the model.
 When you finish casting the spell, the area you have designated via the scale model becomes your domain, granting you a number of magical benefits, both while in the area and outside of it. The area of the domain stretches to 50 feet beneath the ground of the marked area, and 50 feet above the tallest building in the area.
 While within the boundaries of your domain, you know the location and type of any creature of size Tiny or larger within the domain. Additionally, you can communicate telepathically with any creature in the domain capable of understanding at least one language, even if you and the creature do not share a language. While within your domain, you can use an action to teleport to any other location inside of the boundaries of your domain. If you attempt to teleport to a location occupied by another creature or object, you are shunted into the nearest unoccupied space, taking 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you are moved in this way.
 While both inside and outside of your domain, as long as you are on the same plane as your domain, you are capable of automatically detecting when another creature that is Tiny or larger enters or exits the domain.
 When you finish casting the spell, you may also choose one of the following effects, which last for the duration of the spell:
 Charmed Respite: Choose a secondary area no larger than 50 square feet that is within the area of the spell. This area is blessed with magical charms and protections. Creatures in the area can not be charmed or frightened, and are immune to magical scrying. Any creature that finishes a long rest within the area recovers all lost hit points and is cured of any diseases or poisons.
 Magnificent Mansion: You create a magical entryway on a surface of your choice within your domain, which leads to an extradimensional dwelling of the same type as if you had cast the magnificent mansion spell. The dwelling and its entrance remain accessible for the duration of the spell, and is accessible only to you and creatures that you designate when casting this spell. Creatures and objects not created by the spell’s effects that are in the extradimensional space when the spell ends are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the entrance.
 Teleportation Circle: You create a semi-permanent teleportation circle at a location of your choice within your domain, as if you had cast the spell of the same name. You choose the sigil sequence for the circle.
 If you cast this spell on the same location every day for 30 days, its effects become permanent. You can change which of the three additional features are in effect each time you cast the spell. However, when the spell’s effects become permanent, the additional chosen effect also becomes permanent, and can no longer be changed."
Color Shift,0,Illusion,1 action,Touch,"V, S",1 hour,"Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard",Spooktober 2021 Homebrew Spells,"By touching an object no larger than 5 cubic feet in size, you change the color of the object’s surface, which remains the chosen color for the spell’s duration or until you use a bonus action on your turn to dismiss the effect. Scratching, scraping, or otherwise exposing another layer of the object reveals its true color.
 If you cast this spell multiple times, you can affect up to 10 objects at a time. If you attempt to cast the spell on another object, the effects of the oldest casting of the spell wear off."
Contaminate Water,5,Necromancy,1 action (ritual),Touch,"V, S, M (a piece of rotting flesh, consumed in the casting)",Special,Druid,Spooktober 2021 Homebrew Spells,"Your touch corrupts a body of water, infusing it with a poisonous contamination that renders it dangerous for consumption. This water source can consist of up to ten 10-foot cubes, and must be no larger than 7500 gallons– this could be a barrel of water, a well, or even a small pond.
 Any creature that consumes water from the contaminated source must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. Creatures living within the water source immediately begin to suffocate, unable to breathe the water normally. A creature poisoned in this way loses 1d4 points of Strength at the end of each long rest, at which point it may repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. An affected creature can also be cured with lesser restoration, remove curse, or similar magic. A creature whose Strength is reduced this way recovers 1d4 Strength for each day of downtime it spends resting after being cured. A creature whose Strength is reduced to 0 dies immediately.
 A contained water source, such as a barrel or keg, remains contaminated indefinitely. A filtered source, such as a well or pond, is contaminated for 7 days, after which the contamination clears naturally. A contaminated source can be cleared with the dispel magic spell, or by casting the hallow spell on any portion of the water source.

Each creature that can see the orb and starts its turn within 30 feet of it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the start of their next turn. If a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it is immune to the spell’s effects for the rest of the spell’s duration.
 As a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns for the spell’s duration, you can move the orb up to 15 feet. The orb can pass through creatures, objects, and walls and any attempt to physically interact with the orb fails. If the orb moves out of your line of sight or further than 60 feet away from you, the spell automatically ends.
 When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures within range as immune to the spell’s effects."
Discern Fauna,1,Necromancy,1 action,Touch,S,Instantaneous,"Druid, Ranger",Spooktober 2021 Homebrew Spells,"By touching the body part of a creature, you are able to identify specific characteristics about the creature the body part came from. The body part may be as small as a tooth or claw, or as large as an entire limb. When you touch the body part, you are granted knowledge of the type of creature that it came from, such as aberration, celestial, humanoid, etc.
 If the creature was a beast, dragon, monstrosity, or plant you are also able to identify the defining characteristics of the creature in question. For example, touching the tooth of a dragon would allow you to identify the color of dragon it came from, while touching the skull of a fox would allow you to identify it as such.
 If you are a druid and you cast this spell on the body part of a beast, the knowledge gained by use of the spell is enough to allow you to assume its shape using the Wild Shape class feature."

For the spell’s duration, each time a creature within 20 feet of you hits you with an attack, it automatically takes 1d8 psychic damage. If the damage is from a critical hit, the attacker instead takes twice as much damage.
 A creature damaged by this spell has disadvantage on any resulting saving throw made to maintain concentration.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage dealt to the attacker increases based on the level of the spell slot used: 1d10 at 6th and 7th level, and 1d12 at 8th and 9th level."

It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and it does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it comes under your control until the spell ends or you or your companions do anything harmful to it. If the target’s Intelligence is 4 or less, it automatically fails this saving throw.
 While under your control, the creature obeys all verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required). If the target;s Intelligence is 5 or greater, at the end of each of its turns, or if the target is given a command that would cause direct harm to it, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the spell on a success.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them."

Choose a point within range. The ground within a 60-foot radius of that point bursts with an immense tangle of plant-life, which quickly grows to an enormous height.
 If there are already plants in the spell’s radius of effect, these plants become thick and overgrown. Otherwise new plants appear in the area, of a type which would be expected for the environment. None of the new plants that appear are edible, and do not provide sustenance.
 A creature moving through the area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. The plants are tall and dense enough that any Large or smaller creature in the area is lightly obscured and benefits from half-cover.
 When you cast this spell, you may choose one of the following types of plants to also appear in the area, causing additional effects based on the type of plant chosen. You can also designate up to four creatures, including yourself, as immune to the effects of the plants in the area.
 Pain Bush. A creature that enters the area for the first time on its turn or that starts its turn in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. A creature that leaves the area can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
 Poison Ivy. A creature that enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or suffer from an extreme rash. Creatures suffering from this rash have disadvantage on Dexterity-based ability checks and saving throws made to maintain concentration.
 Stinging Nettle. If a creature enters the area of the spell, or starts its turn in the area and moves at least 5 feet on its turn, it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 acid damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one."

Creatures that fail this saving throw take 2d6 fire damage and are blinded for 1d4 rounds by the ash and sparks. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half as much damage and is not blinded. If a creature is blinded by the spell, it or another creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to wipe the soot from the blinded creature’s eyes, ending the condition on it."
Forgeman’s Touch,1,Transmutation,1 hr,Touch,"S, M (raw materials equal in value to the gp cost of the crafted item)",Instantaneous,"Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard",Spooktober 2021 Homebrew Spells,"Under your hands, the raw materials used as components in the casting of this spell shape themselves into a single nonmagical item equal or lesser in value than the raw materials used to create it. The spell consumes an amount of the raw materials necessary to create the item, leaving the remainder untouched. If the created object is of a liquid or gaseous material, it can be caused to automatically appear in an empty container nearby when you finish casting the spell.
 The crafted item can be a suit of armor, a shield, a weapon, or some other mundane item, but must be something which could conceivably be made with the raw materials at hand. You could not, for example, create a mirror using wood, or a candle out of steel.
 The crafted item is of a high enough quality that its uses and statistics remain the same. However, a trained craftsman, such as the type that might normally buy a similar object, is able to determine at a glance that the handiwork is shoddy and amateur, and will often refuse to purchase or sell such items.
 You can use this spell to replicate the appearance of a specific object if that object is within your sight for the duration of the spell’s casting, allowing you to duplicate an object such as a key or a weapon with a unique appearance. A creature familiar with the object that inspects it can tell it is a copy by succeeding on an Wisdom (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
 An object created by the spell remains whole for 72 hours, at which point it breaks back down into its constituent components. A creature wearing, carrying, or otherwise using an object crafted by this spell at the moment the spell’s effects end suffers no negative consequences from this process. If an object created by this spell was consumed during the spell’s duration, such as a candle, perfume, or soap, it is consumed for good, and its materials do not reappear when the spell ends."
Fuse Flesh,6,Transmutation,1 action (ritual),Touch,S,1 minute (special),"Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard",Spooktober 2021 Homebrew Spells,"As your fingers brush against the target’s skin, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its flesh begin to ripple, shifting and fusing together to create a seamless whole, trapping the creature under a smooth blanket of its own skin. Shapechangers, amorphous creatures, and creatures without flesh automatically succeed on this saving throw.
 While under the spell’s effects, the target is prone, its automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws, its speed is reduced to 0, and it is incapacitated. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, its face also fuses over, blinding and deafening it. If this happens, the target can still breathe, eat, and drink. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
 In order to cast this spell as a ritual, the target must be restrained or unconscious. If you do, the duration increases to 1 hour, and can not be ended by a successful saving throw. However, you can end the spell using a bonus action on your turn."
Holzur’s Hidden Home,6,Illusion,1 hr,60 ft,"V, S, M (a polished and gilded silver mirror worth at least 200 gp, consumed in the casting)",7 days,Wizard,Spooktober 2021 Homebrew Spells,"This spell hides a structure from view, disguising and obscuring it from prying eyes. Choose a structure that you can see within range that is no larger than 2000 cubic feet, such as a townhome, a small guildhouse, or a workshop. You craft an illusion over the building and its surrounding environment that hides it from view.
 Other creatures can not see the structure, and do not notice any signs that the structure is there. For example, if you cast this spell on a townhome, other creatures do not see the building, but also see no evidence of a “gap” between the surrounding buildings. Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion, and detect and interact with the structure as normal.
 When you finish casting this spell, you can designate any number of creatures within range as being immune to the spell’s effects. The chosen creatures are able to see and interact with the target as normal. You can also choose a password which, when spoken within 60 feet of the target, allows the speaker to detect the structure as normal. Speaking this password while within 60 feet of the target also allows you to choose a new password, as well as designate any number of additional creatures as being immune to the spell’s effects.
 If a creature is attempting to locate the target and knows its position, but can not detect the structure due to the spell’s effects, it can make a Wisdom saving throw to attempt to find the building. If the creature fails the saving throw, the target remains hidden from it, and it can not repeat the saving throw for 12 hours. Otherwise the creature sees through the illusion, allowing it to detect and interact with the target as normal.
 If you cast this spell on the same target every day for 30 days, the effects of the spell become permanent. As long as the duration of each casting of the spell overlaps, and the spell does not end for the target, any creatures chosen by you to be able to see through the spell’s effects remain immune to the illusion, and any password chosen continues to function as normal."

Choose a point you can see within range. The area within a 30-foot radius around the chosen point is pummeled by the winds, which howl and rage.
 Objects within the radius that are not being worn or carried are thrown 30 feet in a direction of your choice. Each creature within the radius must make a Strength saving throw, followed by a Constitution saving throw. Deafened creatures and creatures that can not hear automatically succeed on the Constitution saving throw.
 Creatures that fail the Strength saving throw are pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice and knocked prone, while creatures that fail the Constitution saving throw take 4d8 thunder damage and are deafened until the end of your next turn.
 At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the distance a creature is pushed increases by 5 feet, and the thunder damage dealt increases by 1d8, for each slot level above 6th."

When you cast this spell and as an action on each of your turns for the spell’s duration, you can cause a 30-foot tall, 5-foot radius spike of ice to burst from the ground at a point of your choice that you can see within 300 feet.
 When the spike appears, any creature in the spike’s radius or in the air above it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature that fails the saving throw and takes the cold damage is also affected by the extreme cold, reducing its movement speed by half until the start of your next turn.
 The spike is large enough to provide full cover for a creature behind it, though clear enough that creatures can be seen almost perfectly through the ice. The ice spike melts when you create another spike, when it is exposed to high heat, or 10 minutes after the spell ends."

These temporary hit points disappear when the spell ends. If this reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is knocked unconscious but immediately stabilizes."

If it has been between 12 and 24 hours, the gourd can feed 2 people. If it has been between 6 and 12 hours since you last cast this spell, the gourd can feed one individual.

In addition, any creature that spends hit dice during this short rest automatically regains 1 additional hit point for each hit die spent this way.

The light can not be put out through normal means, and disappears when the spell ends. The spell ends immediately if you let go of the lantern.
 If you shine the beam of light on a trap, secret entryway, or invisible creature or object, it is outlined in an unearthly light, revealing its location. The beam of light does not reveal the mechanism controlling a trap or secret entryway, and anything which moves out of the light is no longer highlighted.
 If the beam of light passes over a magical object, it outlines the object in a glowing light, the color of which is determined by the school of magic affecting the object, if any.

That target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the created shadow merges with the target’s shadow, unnoticed and invisible. Otherwise the spell fails.
 The shadow created by this spell trails the target for the duration, staying within the target’s shadow at all times and allowing you to sense the direction to the target’s location as long as it is on the same plane as you.

 If the target did not take any actions on its previous turn, it can’t take any on the turn it is affected by this spell. The target can still make reactions as normal, but can not take actions or bonus actions on its turn that it did not take last turn.

 The swarm can not leave your space, and if for any reason you and the swarm are separated, or if the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears and the spell immediately ends.
 Whenever a creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you while you are surrounded by the swarm, the swarm attacks it. If you would take damage while surrounded by the swarm, roll a d20.

 In addition, if the target attempts to cast a spell that requires a verbal component, it must succeed on a spellcasting ability check against your spell save DC or fail in its attempt to cast the spell. Doing so does not expend the spell slot used to cast the spell.
 A remove curse spell ends the spell's effects on the target.

This process repeats at the start of each of your turns for the spell's duration, with the spell's target on the previous turn choosing the target of the spell on the next turn.If a sentient magical item would be transported to the demiplane created by this spell, it can make an additional Charisma saving throw, preventing the spell's effects upon itself on a success. A sentient magical item that fails this saving throw and is transported to the demiplane can repeat the saving throw at the end of each round. On a success, the sentient magical item is transported back to the Material Plane, appearing in either the space it previously occupied, or next to the person which was holding it at the time it vanished, its choice.At the GM's discretion, certain powerful magic items such as artifacts or legendary items may be immune to the effects of this spell.
